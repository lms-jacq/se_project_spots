# Project 3: Spots

## Description

Spots is an interactive social platform where users have the ability to add and remove photos, and edit their profiles.

## Tech Stack

-HTML
-CSS
-Figma
-Responsive design

By analyzing the Figma, we (students) will learn how to transfer these elements to our HTML file and apply the correct rules in our CSS classes.

Along with Figma, media query was applied so that this is tailored between desktop and mobile view. Text overflow was also inserted to ensure these'll be hidden by an ellipsis.

At the end of Project 3, we should be more familiar with designing a responsive website.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
